<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created this project to enhance my existing knowledge in Vue 3 especially in using Composition API and Pinia data store. I used this open API which has tons of pokemon data <a href="https://pokeapi.co">https://pokeapi.co</a>

I also used Headless-UI library to add dynamic components like dropdown in this project. For browser-based testing I included Cypress library into this project.
